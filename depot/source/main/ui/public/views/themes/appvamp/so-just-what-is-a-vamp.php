	<p class="about" >
	A Vamp, darling, is a seductive woman who exploits men by using her sexual charms. We don.t have to go that far. but yes, the AppVamp is definitely a seductress.

	<br	/>
	<br	/>

	And 'App'?  Well, thats because I just looooove mobile phone apps.  And I plan on talking about some of my favorite apps.

	<br/>
	<br	/>
	As you may have guessed, 'Vamp' is short for 'vampiress'

	<br/>
	<br	/>
	The first known use of the word was in the 1915 film "A Fool There Was", with the seducing Theda Bara in the role of The Vampire. The title and concept was based on a Kipling poem, 'The Vampire'.
I think the poem is simply delicious. Here it is, for your pleasure:

	A fool there was and he made his prayer 
	<br	/>
	(Even as you and I!) 
	<br	/>
	  To a rag and a bone and a hank of hair
	<br	/>
  (We called her the woman who did not care)
	<br	/>
  But the fool, he called her his lady fair
	<br	/>
  (Even as you and I.)
	<br	/>
	<br	/>

  Oh the years we waste and the tears we waste
	<br	/>
  And the work of our head and hand,
	<br	/>
  Belong to the woman who did not know
	<br	/>
  (And now we know that she never could know)
	<br	/>
  And did not understand.
	<br	/>
	<br	/>

  A fool there was and his goods he spent
	<br	/>
  (Even as you and I!)
	<br	/>
  Honor and faith and a sure intent
	<br	/>
  But a fool must follow his natural bent
	<br	/>
  (And it wasn.t the least what the lady meant),
	<br	/>
  (Even as you and I!)
	<br	/>
	<br	/>

  Oh the toil we lost and the spoil we lost
	<br	/>
  And the excellent things we planned,
	<br	/>
  Belong to the woman who didn.t know why
	<br	/>
  (And now we know she never knew why)
	<br	/>
  And did not understand.
	<br	/>

	<br	/>
  The fool we stripped to his foolish hide
	<br	/>
  (Even as you and I!)
	<br	/>
  Which she might have seen when she threw him aside.
	<br	/>
  (But it isn.t on record the lady tried)
	<br	/>
  So some of him lived but the most of him died.
	<br	/>
  (Even as you and I!)
	<br	/>

	<br	/>
  And it isn.t the shame and it isn.t the blame
	<br	/>
  That stings like a white hot brand.
	<br	/>

	<br	/>
  It.s coming to know that she never knew why
	<br	/>
  (Seeing at last she could never know why)
	<br	/>
  And never could understand.
